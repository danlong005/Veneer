# Veneer

Veneer renders IBM i 5250 green-screen applications as modern web pages without
changing host code. It runs on the IBM i (PASE) or on any other machine with Node.js 20+.

## Packages

| Package | Status | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `packages/tn5250` | Milestone 1 | Pure TypeScript TN5250 client: Telnet/TLS, 5250 data stream, screen model |
| `packages/server` | planned | Session server: one host session per browser tab over WebSocket |
| `packages/client` | planned | Browser renderer with auto-transform rules |

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm test              # unit tests (node:test, runs TypeScript directly)
npm run build         # compile to dist/ for deployment
cp .env.example .env  # then set VENEER_HOST etc.
npm run cli           # interactive session against your IBM i
```

In the CLI, `3=QSECOFR` stages a value for input field 3, and `enter`, `f3`, `pgdn`, etc.
send it. `VENEER_TRACE=traces/name.jsonl npm run cli` records every raw 5250 record
for building test fixtures. Traces contain everything typed, including passwords,
and `traces/` is git-ignored.
